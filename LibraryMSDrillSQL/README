This is a library management system I created using T-SQL in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 2014. The first file titled "uspdBCreator" is a stored procedure that will create the library management system database and populate it with data. The second file titled "uspQueries" is a stored procedure that, when executed, will run a series of queries that will return data that meet a variety of different business scenarios/criteria. For example, one query returns a list of borrower names, addresses, and the number of books that they have checked out to them, if the number of books they have checked out is equal to or greater than five.
