The code samples in this folder are snippets of code from a web application I worked for a client as a software development intern at ProsperIT. The web application is called Bewander. I spent two and half weeks interning for this company. My accomplishments included streamlining and cleaning up elements of the front-end, updating an edit action of a controller to be in line with security best practices (protect against overposting attacks), and implementing an external Facebook login using the Facebook API and Javascript SDK.
