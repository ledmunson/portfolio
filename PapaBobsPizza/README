This was a coding challenge I completed that was designed to give me practice with object oriented programming and creating the different layers of the web application using .NET Web Forms. This challenge has presentation, domain, persistence, and DTO layers. The web application is a pizza ordering form that will dynamically update the total price of the order based on what toppings, pizza size, etc. are selected. There is validation present so that if key information is missing from the order form, an exception will be thrown and an error message will display to the user with information on what caused the exception. The orders are persisted to the "Orders" table in the database. There also is a "PizzaPrice" table which is used to store the cost of various items such as the cost of different pizza sizes and the cost of different toppings. The languages used in creating this web application are C#, HTML, and CSS. 

When an order is successfully completed and persisted to the database, a "success" page will load which serves to let the user know that their order went through and was saved to the database. Open orders can be viewed on the OrderManagement.aspx webpage and completed orders can be removed from the order manager by clicking the "Complete" link. These orders are not deleted from the database, however.
